the wonderful musicant here was once a wonderful musician who went quite alone through a forest and thought of all manner of things and when nothing was left for him to think about he said to himself time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest i will fetch hither a good companion for myself then he took his fiddle from his back and played so that it echoed through the trees it was not long before a wolf came trotting through the thicket towards him ah here is a wolf coming i have no desire for him said the musician but the wolf came nearer and said to him ah dear musician how beautifully thou dost play i should like to learn that too it is soon learnt the musician replied thou hast only to do all that i bid thee oh musician said the wolf i will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master the musician bade him follow and when they had gone part of the way together they came to an old oaktree which was hollow inside and cleft in the middle look said the musician if thou wilt learn to fiddle put thy fore paws into this crevice the wolf obeyed but the musician quickly picked up a stone and with one blow wedged his two paws so fast that he was forced to stay there like a prisoner stay there until i come back again said the musician and went his way after a while he again said to himself time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest i will fetch hither another companion and took his fiddle and again played in the forest it was not long before a fox came creeping through the trees towards him ah theres a fox coming said the musician i have no desire for him the fox came up to him and said oh dear musician how beautifully thou dost play i should like to learn that too that is soon learnt said the musician thou hast only to do everything that i bid thee oh musician then said the fox i will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master follow me said the musician and when they had walked a part of the way they came to a footpath with high bushes on both sides of it there the musician stood still and from one side bent a young hazel bush down to the ground and put his foot on the top of it then he bent down a young tree from the other side as well and said now little fox if thou wilt learn something give me thy left front paw the fox obeyed and the musician fastened his paw to the left bough little fox said he now reach me thy right paw and he tied it to the right bough when he had examined whether they were firm enough he let go and the bushes sprang up again and jerked up the little fox so that it hung struggling in the air wait there till i come back again said the musician and went his way again he said to himself time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest i will fetch hither another companion so he took his fiddle and the sound echoed through the forest then a little hare came springing towards him why a hare is coming said the musician i do not want him ah dear musician said the hare how beautifully thou dost fiddle i too should like to learn that that is soon learnt said the musician thou hast only to do everything that i bid thee oh musician replied the little hare i will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master they went a part of the way together until they came to an open space in the forest where stood an aspen tree the musician tied a long string round the little hares neck the other end of which he fastened to the tree now briskly little hare run twenty times round the tree cried the musician and the little hare obeyed and when it had run round twenty times it had twisted the string twenty times round the trunk of the tree and the little hare was caught and let it pull and tug as it liked it only made the string cut into its tender neck wait there till i come back said the musician and went onwards the wolf in the meantime had pushed and pulled and bitten at the stone and had worked so long that he had set his feet at liberty and had drawn them once more out of the cleft full of anger and rage he hurried after the musician and wanted to tear him to pieces when the fox saw him running he began to lament and cried with all his might brother wolf come to my help the musician has betrayed me the wolf drew down the little tree bit the cord in two and freed the fox who went with him to take revenge on the musician they found the tied up hare whom likewise they delivered and then they all sought the enemy together the musician had once more played his fiddle as he went on his way and this time he had been more fortunate the sound reached the ears of a poor woodcutter who instantly whether he would or no gave up his work and came with his hatchet under his arm to listen to the music at last comes the right companion said the musician for i was seeking a human being and no wild beast and he began and played so beautifully and delightfully that the poor man stood there as if bewitched and his heart leaped with gladness and as he thus stood the wolf the fox and the hare came up and he saw well that they had some evil design so he raised his glittering axe and placed himself before the musician as if to say whoso wishes to touch him let him beware for he will have to do with me then the beasts were terrified and ran back into the forest the musician however played once more to the man out of gratitude and then went onwards the gallant tailor seven at one blow one summer morning a little tailor was sitting on his board near the window and working cheerfully with all his might when an old woman came down the street crying good jelly to sell good jelly to sell the cry sounded pleasant in the little tailors ears so he put his head out of the window and called out here my good woman come here if you want a customers the poor woman climbed the steps with her heavy basket and was obliged to unpack and display all her pots to the tailor he looked at every one of them and lifting all the lids applied his nose to each and said at last the jelly seems pretty good you may weigh me out four half ounces or i dont mind having a quarter of a pound the woman who had expected to find a good customer gave him what he asked for but went off angry and grumbling this jelly is the very thing for me cried the little tailor it will give me strength and cunning and he took down the bread from the cupboard cut a whole round of the loaf and spread the jelly on it laid it near him and went on stitching more gallantly than everall the while the scent of the sweet jelly was spreading throughout the room where there were quantities of flies who were attracted by it and flew to partake now then who asked you to come said the tailor and drove the unbidden guests away but the flies not understanding his language were not to be got rid of like that and returned in larger numbers than before then the tailor not being able to stand it any longer took from his chimney corner a ragged cloth and saying now ill let you have it beat it among them unmercifully when he ceased and counted the slain he found seven lying dead before him this is indeed somewhat he said wondering at his own gallantry the whole town shall know this so he hastened to cut out a belt and he stitched it and put on it in large capitals seven at one blow the town did i say said the little tailor the whole world shall know it and his heart quivered with joy like a lambs tail the tailor fastened the belt round him and began to think of going out into the world for his workshop seemed too small for his worship so he looked about in all the house for something that it would be useful to take with him but he found nothing but an old cheese which he put in his pocket outside the door he noticed that a bird had got caught in the bushes so he took that and put it in his pocket with the cheese then he set out gallantly on his way and as he was light and active he felt no fatigue the way led over a mountain and when he reached the topmost peak he saw a terrible giant sitting there and looking about him at his ease the tailor went bravely up to him called out to him and said comrade good day there you sit looking over the wide world i am on the way thither to seek my fortune have you a fancy to go with methe giant looked at the tailor contemptuously and said you little rascal you miserable fellow that may be answered the little tailor and undoing his coat he showed the giant his belt you can read there whether i am a man or not the giant read seven at one blow and thinking it meant men that the tailor had killed felt at once more respect for the little fellow but as he wanted to prove him he took up a stone and squeezed it so hard that water came out of it now you can do that said the giant that is if you have the strength for it thats not much said the little tailor i call that play and he put his hand in his pocket and took out the cheese and squeezed it so that the whey ran out of it well said he what do you think of that the giant did not know what to say to it for he could not have believed it of the little man then the giant took up a stone and threw it so high that it was nearly out of sight now little fellow suppose you do that well thrown said the tailor but the stone fell back to earth again i will throw you one that will never come back so he felt in his pocket took out the bird and threw it into the air and the bird when it found itself at liberty took wing flew off and returned no more what do you think of that comrade asked the tailor there is no doubt that you can throw said the giant but we will see if you can carry he led the little tailor to a mighty oaktree which had been felled and was lying on the ground and said now if you are strong enough help me to carry this tree out of the wood willingly answered the little man you take the trunk on your shoulders i will take the branches with all their foliage that is much the most difficult so the giant took the trunk on his shoulders and the tailor seated himself on a branch and the giant who could not see what he was doing had the whole tree to carry and the little man on it as well and the little man was very cheerful and merry and whistled the tune there were three tailors riding by as if carrying the tree was mere childs play the giant when he had struggled on under his heavy load a part of the way was tired out and cried look here i must let go the tree the tailor jumped off quickly and taking hold of the tree with both arms as if he were carrying it said to the giant you see you cant carry the tree though you are such a big fellow they went on together a little farther and presently they came to a cherrytree and the giant took hold of the topmost branches where the ripest fruit hung and pulling them downwards gave them to the tailor to hold bidding him eat but the little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree and as the giant let go the tree sprang back and the tailor was caught up into the air and when he dropped down again without any damage the giant said to him how is this havent you strength enough to hold such a weak sprig as that it is not strength that is lacking answered the little tailor how should it to one who has slain seven at one blow i just jumped over the tree because the hunters are shooting down there in the bushes you jump it too if you can the giant made the attempt and not being able to vault the tree he remained hanging in the branches so that once more the little tailor got the better of him then said the giant as you are such a gallant fellow suppose you come with me to our den and stay the night the tailor was quite willing and he followed him when they reached the den there sat some other giants by the fire and each had a roasted sheep in his hand and was eating it the little tailor looked round and thought there is more elbow room here than in my workshop and the giant showed him a bed and told him he had better lie down upon it and go to sleep the bed was however too big for the tailor so he did not stay in it but crept into a corner to sleep as soon as it was midnight the giant got up took a great staff of iron and beat the bed through with one stroke and supposed he had made an end of that grasshopper of a tailor very early in the morning the giants went into the wood and forgot all about the little tailor and when they saw him coming after them alive and merry they were terribly frightened and thinking he was going to kill them they ran away in all has teso the little tailor marched on always following his nose and after he had gone a great way he entered the courtyard belonging to a kings palace and there he felt so overpowered with fatigue that he lay down and fell asleep in the meanwhile came various people who looked at him very curiously and read on his belt seven at one blow oh said they why should this great lord come here in time of peace what a mighty champion he must be then they went and told the king about him and they thought that if war should break out what a worthy and useful man he would be and that he ought not to be allowed to depart at any price the king then summoned his council and sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to beg him so soon as he should wake up to consent to serve in the kings army so the messenger stood and waited at the sleepers side until his limbs began to stretch and his eyes to open and then he carried his answer back and the answer was that was the reason for which i came said the little tailor i am ready to enter the kings service so he was received into it very honourably and a separate dwelling set apart for him but the rest of the soldiers were very much set against the little tailor and they wished him a thousand miles away what shall be done about it they said among themselves if we pick a quarrel and fight with him then seven of us will fall at each blow that will be of no good to us so they came to a resolution and went all together to the king to ask for their discharge we never intended said they to serve with a man who kills seven at a blow the king felt sorry to lose all his faithful servants because of one man and he wished that he had never seen him and would willingly get rid of him if he might but he did not dare to dismiss the little tailor for fear he should kill all the kings people and place himself upon the throne he thought a long while about it and at last made up his mind what to do he sent for the little tailor and told him that as he was so great a warrior he had a proposal to make to him he told him that in a wood in his dominions dwelt two giants who did great damage by robbery murder and fire and that no man durst go near them for fear of his life but that if the tailor should overcome and slay both these giants the king would give him his only daughter in marriage and half his kingdom as dowry and that a hundred horsemen should go with him to give him assistance that would be something for a man like me thought the little tailor a beautiful princess and half a kingdom are not to be had every day and he said to the king oh yes i can soon overcome the giants and yet have no need of the hundred horsemen he who can kill seven at one blow has no need to be afraid of two so the little tailor set out and the hundred horsemen followed him when he came to the border of the wood he said to his escort stay here while i go to attack the giants then he sprang into the wood and looked about him right and left after a while he caught sight of the two giants they were lying down under a tree asleep and snoring so that all the branches shook the little tailor all alive filled both his pockets with stones and climbed up into the tree and made his way to an overhanging bough so that he could seat himself just above the sleepers and from there he let one stone after another fall on the chest of one of the giants for a long time the giant was quite unaware of this but at last he waked up and pushed his comrade and said what are you hitting me for you are dreaming said the other i am not touching you and they composed themselves again to sleep and the tailor let fall a stone on the other giant what can that be cried he what are you casting at mei am casting nothing at you answered the first grumbling they disputed about it for a while but as they were tired they gave it up at last and their eyes closed once more then the little tailor began his game anew picked out a heavier stone and threw it down with force upon the first giants chest this is too much cried he and sprang up like a madman and struck his companion such a blow that the tree shook above them the other paid him back with ready coin and they fought with such fury that they tore up trees by their roots to use for weapons against each other so that at last they both of them lay dead upon the ground and now the little tailor got down another piece of luck said he that the tree i was sitting in did not get torn up too or else i should have had to jump like a squirrel from one tree to another then he drew his sword and gave each of the giants a few hacks in the breast and went back to the horsemen and said the deed is done i have made an end of both of them but it went hard with me in the struggle they rooted up trees to defend themselves but it was of no use they had to do with a man who can kill seven at one blow then are you not wounded asked the horsemen nothing of the sort answered the tailor i have not turned a hair the horsemen still would not believe it and rode into the wood to see and there they found the giants wallowing in their blood and all about them lying the uprooted trees the little tailor then claimed the promised boon but the king repented him of his offer and he sought again how to rid himself of the hero before you can possess my daughter and the half of my kingdom said he to the tailor you must perform another heroic act in the wood lives a unicorn who does great damage you must secure hima unicorn does not strike more terror into me than two giants seven at one blow that is my way was the tailors answer so taking a rope and an axe with him he went out into the wood and told those who were ordered to attend him to wait outside he had not far to seek the unicorn soon came out and sprang at him as if he would make an end of him without delay softly softly said he most haste worst speed and remained standing until the animal came quite near then he slipped quietly behind a tree the unicorn ran with all his might against the tree and stuck his horn so deep into the trunk that he could not get it out again and so was taken now i have you said the tailor coming out from behind the tree and putting the rope round the unicorns neck he took the axe set free the horn and when all his party were assembled he led forth the animal and brought it to the king the king did not yet wish to give him the promised reward and set him a third task to do before the wedding could take place the tailor was to secure a wild boar which had done a great deal of damage in the wood the huntsmen were to accompany him all right said the tailor this is childs play but he did not take the huntsmen into the wood and they were all the better pleased for the wild boar had many a time before received them in such a way that they had no fancy to disturb him when the boar caught sight of the tailor he ran at him with foaming mouth and gleaming tusks to bear him to the ground but the nimble hero rushed into a chapel which chanced to be near and jumped quickly out of a window on the other side the boar ran after him and when he got inside the door shut after him and there he was imprisoned for the creature was too big and unwieldy to jump out of the window too then the little tailor called the huntsmen that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes and then he betook himself to the king who now whether he liked it or not was obliged to fulfil his promise and give him his daughter and the half of his kingdom but if he had known that the great warrior was only a little tailor he would have taken it still more to heart so the wedding was celebrated with great splendour and little joy and the tailor was made into a kingone night the young queen heard her husband talking in his sleep and saying now boy make me that waistcoat and patch me those breeches or i will lay my yard measure about your shoulders and so as she perceived of what low birth her husband was she went to her father the next morning and told him all and begged him to set her free from a man who was nothing better than a tailor the king bade her be comforted saying tonight leave your bedroom door open my guard shall stand outside and when he is asleep they shall come in and bind him and carry him off to a ship and he shall be sent to the other side of the world so the wife felt consoled but the kings water bearer who had been listening all the while went to the little tailor and disclosed to him the whole plan i shall put a stop to all this said heat night he lay down as usual in bed and when his wife thought that he was asleep she got up opened the door and lay down again the little tailor who only made believe to be asleep began to murmur plainly now boy make me that waistcoat and patch me those breeches or i will lay my yard measure about your shoulders i have slain seven at one blow killed two giants caught a unicorn and taken a wild boar and shall i be afraid of those who are standing outside my room door and when they heard the tailor say this a great fear seized them they fled away as if they had been wild hares and none of them would venture to attack him and so the little tailor all his lifetime remained a king sleeping beauty beauty in times past there lived a king and queen who said to each other every day of their lives would that we had a child and yet they had none but it happened once that when the queen was bathing there came a frog out of the water and he squatted on the ground and said to her thy wish shall be fulfilled before a year has gone by thou shalt bring a daughter into the world and as the frog foretold so it happened and the queen bore a daughter so beautiful that the king could not contain himself for joy and he ordained a great feast not only did he bid to it his relations friends and acquaintances but also the wise women that they might be kind and favourable to the child there were thirteen of them in his kingdom but as he had only provided twelve golden plates for them to eat from one of them had to be left out however the feast was celebrated with all splendour and as it drew to an end the wise women stood forward to present to the child their wonderful gifts one bestowed virtue one beauty a third riches and so on whatever there is in the world to wish for and when eleven of them had said their say in came the uninvited thirteenth burning to revenge herself and without greeting or respect she cried with a loud voice in the fifteenth year of her age the princess shall prick herself with a spindle and shall fall down dead and without speaking one more word she turned away and left the hall every one was terrified at her saying when the twelfth came forward for she had not yet bestowed her gift and though she could not do away with the evil prophecy yet she could soften it so she said the princess shall not die but fall into a deep sleep for a hundred years now the king being desirous of saving his child even from this misfortune gave commandment that all the spindles in his kingdom should be burnt up the maiden grew up adorned with all the gifts of the wise women and she was so lovely modest sweet and kind and clever that no one who saw her could help loving her it happened one day she being already fifteen years old that the king and queen rode abroad and the maiden was left behind alone in the castle she wandered about into all the nooks and corners and into all the chambers and parlours as the fancy took her till at last she came to an old tower she climbed the narrow winding stair which led to a little door with a rusty key sticking out of the lock she turned the key and the door opened and there in the little room sat an old woman with a spindle diligently spinning her flax good day mother said the princess what are you doing i am spinning answered the old woman nodding her head what thing is that that twists round so briskly asked the maiden and taking the spindle into her hand she began to spin but no sooner had she touched it than the evil prophecy was fulfilled and she pricked her finger with it in that very moment she fell back upon the bed that stood there and lay in a deep sleep and this sleep fell upon the whole castle the king and queen who had returned and were in the great hall fell fast asleep and with them the whole court the horses in their stalls the dogs in the yard the pigeons on the roof the flies on the wall the very fire that flickered on the hearth became still and slept like the rest and the meat on the spit ceased roasting and the cook who was going to pull the scullions hair for some mistake he had made let him go and went to sleep and the wind ceased and not a leaf fell from the trees about the castle then round about that place there grew a hedge of thorns thicker every year until at last the whole castle was hidden from view and nothing of it could be seen but the vane on the roof and a rumour went abroad in all that country of the beautiful sleeping rosamond for so was the princess called and from time to time many kings sons came and tried to force their way through the hedge but it was impossible for them to do so for the thorns held fast together like strong hands and the young men were caught by them and not being able to get free there died a lamentable death many a long year afterwards there came a kings son into that country and heard an old man tell how there should be a castle standing behind the hedge of thorns and that there a beautiful enchanted princess named rosamond had slept for a hundred years and with her the king and queen and the whole court the old man had been told by his grandfather that many kings sons had sought to pass the thorn hedge but had been caught and pierced by the thorns and had died a miserable death then said the young man nevertheless i do not fear to try i shall win through and see the lovely rosamond the good old man tried to dissuade him but he would not listen to his words for now the hundred years were at an end and the day had come when rosamond should be awakened when the prince drew near the hedge of thorns it was changed into a hedge of beautiful large flowers which parted and bent aside to let him pass and then closed behind him in a thick hedge when he reached the castle yard he saw the horses and brindled hunting dogs lying asleep and on the roof the pigeons were sitting with their heads under their wings and when he came indoors the flies on the wall were asleep the cook in the kitchen had his hand uplifted to strike the scullion and the kitchen maid had the black fowl on her lap ready to pluck then he mounted higher and saw in the hall the whole court lying asleep and above them on their thrones slept the king and the queen and still he went farther and all was so quiet that he could hear his own breathing and at last he came to the tower and went up the winding stair and opened the door of the little room where rosamond lay and when he saw her looking so lovely in her sleep he could not turn away his eyes and presently he stooped and kissed he rand she awaked and opened her eyes and looked very kindly on him and she rose and they went forth together and the king and the queen and whole court waked up and gazed on each other with great eyes of wonderment and the horses in the yard got up and shook themselves the hounds sprang up and wagged their tails the pigeons on the roof drew their heads from under their wings looked round and flew into the field the flies on the wall crept on a little farther the kitchen fire leapt up and blazed and cooked the meat the joint on the spit began to roast the cook gave the scullion such a box on the ear that he roared out and the maid went on plucking the fowl then the wedding of the prince and rosamond was held with all splendour and they lived very happily together until their lives end rapunzel there once lived a man and his wife who had long wished for a child but in vain now there was at the back of their house a little window which overlooked a beautiful garden full of the finest vegetables and flowers but there was a high wall all round it and no one ventured into it for it belonged to a witch of great might and of whom all the world was afraid one day that the wife was standing at the window and looking into the garden she saw a bed filled with the finest rampion and it looked so fresh and green that she began to wish for some and at length she longed for it greatly this went on for days and as she knew she could not get the rampion she pined away and grew pale and miserable then the man was uneasy and asked what is the matter dear wife oh answered she i shall die unless i can have some of that rampion to eat that grows in the garden at the back of our house the man who loved her very much thought to himself rather than lose my wife i will get some rampion cost what it will so in the twilight he climbed over the wall into the witchs garden plucked hastily a handful of rampion and brought it to his wife she made a salad of it at once and ate of it to her hearts content but she liked it so much and it tasted so good that the next day she longed for it thrice as much as she had done before if she was to have any rest the man must climb over the wall once more so he went in the twilight again and as he was climbing back he saw all at once the witch standing before him and was terribly frightened as she cried with angry eyes how dare you climb over into my garden like a thief and steal my rampion it shall be the worse for you oh answered he be merciful rather than just i have only done it through necessity for my wife saw your rampion out of the window and became possessed with so great a longing that she would have died if she could not have had some to eat then the witch said if it is all as you say you may have as much rampion as you like on one condition the child that will come into the world must be given to me it shall go well with the child and i will care for it like a mother in his distress of mind the man promised everything and when the time came when the child was born the witch appeared and giving the child the name of rapunzel which is the same as rampion she took it away with her rapunzel was the most beautiful child in the world when she was twelve years old the witch shut her up in a tower in the midst of a wood and it had neither steps nor door only a small window above when the witch wished to be let in she would stand below and would cry rapunzel rapunzel let down your hair rapunzel had beautiful long hair that shone like gold when she heard the voice of the witch she would undo the fastening of the upper window unbind the plaits of her hair and let it down twenty ells below and the witch would climb up by it after they had lived thus a few years it happened that as the kings son was riding through the wood he came to the tower and as he drew near he heard a voice singing so sweetly that he stood still and listened it was rapunzel in her loneliness trying to pass away the time with sweet songs the kings son wished to go in to her and sought to find a door in the tower but there was none so he rode home but the song had entered into his heart and every day he went into the wood and listened to it once as he was standing there under a tree he saw the witch come up and listened while she called outo rapunzel rapunzel let down your hair then he saw how rapunzel let down her long tresses and how the witch climbed up by it and went in to her and he said to himself since that is the ladder i will climb it and seek my fortune and the next day as soon as it began to grow dusk he went to the tower and criedo rapunzel rapunzel let down your hair and she let down her hair and the kings son climbed up by it rapunzel was greatly terrified when she saw that a man had come in to her for she had never seen one before but the kings son began speaking so kindly to her and told how her singing had entered into his heart so that he could have no peace until he had seen her herself then rapunzel forgot her terror and when he asked her to take him for her husband and she saw that he was young and beautiful she thought to herself i certainly like him much better than old mother go thel and she put her hand into his hand she said i would willingly go with thee but i do not know how i shall get out when thou comest bring each time a silken rope and i will make a ladder and when it is quite ready i will get down by it out of the tower and thou shalt take me away on thy horse they agreed that he should come to her every evening as the old woman came in the day time so the witch knew nothing of all this until once rapunzel said to her unwittingly mother go thel how is it that you climb up here so slowly and the kings son is with me in a momento wicked child cried the witch what is this i hear i thought i had hidden thee from all the world and thou hast betrayed me in her anger she seized rapunzel by her beautiful hair struck her several times with her left hand and then grasping a pair of shears in her right snip snap the beautiful locks lay on the ground and she was so hardhearted that she took rapunzel and put her in a waste and desert place where she lived in great woe and misery the same day on which she took rapunzel away she went back to the tower in the evening and made fast the severed locks of hair to the window hasp and the kings son came and creed rapunzel rapunzel down your hair then she let the hair down and the kings son climbed up but instead of his dearest rapunzel he found the witch looking at him with wicked glittering eyes aha cried she mocking him you came for your darling but the sweet bird sits no longer in the nest and sings no more the cat has got her and will scratch out your eyes as well rapunzel is lost to you you will see her no more the kings son was beside himself with grief and in his agony he sprang from the tower he escaped with life but the thorns on which he fell put out his eyes then he wandered blind through the wood eating nothing but roots and berries and doing nothing but lament and weep for the loss of his dearest wife so he wandered several years in misery until at last he came to the desert place where rapunzel lived with her twin children that she had borne a boy and a girl at first he heard a voice that he thought he knew and when he reached the place from which it seemed to come rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept and when her tears touched his eyes they became clear again and he could see with them as well as ever then he took her to his kingdom where he was received with great joy and there they lived long and happily once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her but most of all by her grandmother and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child once she gave her a little cap of red velvet which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else so she was always called little redcap one day her mother said to her come little redcap here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine take them to your grandmother she is ill and weak and they will do her good set out before it gets hot and when you are going walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path or you may fall and break the bottle and then your grandmother will get nothing and when you go into her room dont forget to say good morning and dont peep into every corner before you do it i will take great care said little redcap to her mother and gave her hand on it the grandmother lived out in the wood half a league from the village and just as little redcap entered the wood a wolf met her redcap did not know what a wicked creature he was and was not at all afraid of him good day little redcap said he thank you kindly wolf whither away so early little redcap to my grandmothers what have you got in your apron cake and wine yesterday was baking day so poor sick grandmother is to have something good to make her stronger where does your grandmother live little redcap a good quarter of a league farther on in the wood her house stands under the three large oak trees the nut trees are just below you surely must know it replied little redcap the wolf thought to himself what a tender young creature what a nice plump mouthful she will be better to eat than the old woman i must act craftily so as to catch both so he walked for a short time by the side of little redcap and then he said see little redcap how pretty the flowers are about here why do you not look round i believe too that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing you walk gravely along as if you were going to school while everything else out here in the wood is merry little redcap raised her eyes and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees and pretty flowers growing everywhere she thought suppose i take grandmother a fresh nosegay that would please her too it is so early in the day that i shall still get there in good time and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers and whenever she had picked one she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on and ran after it and so got deeper and deeper into the wood meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmothers house and knocked at the door who is there little redcap replied the wolf she is bringing cake and wine open the door lift the latch called out the grandmother i am too weak and cannot get up the wolf lifted the latch the door sprang open and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmothers bed and devoured her then he put on her clothes dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed and drew the curtains little redcap however had been running about picking flowers and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more she remembered her grandmother and set out on the way to her she was surprised to find the cottage door standing open and when she went into the room she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself oh dear how uneasy i feel today and at other times i like being with grandmother so much she called out good morning but received no answer so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains there lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face and looking very strange oh grandmother she said what big ears you have the better to hear you with my child was the reply but grandmother what big eyes you have she said the better to see you with my dear but grandmother what large hands you have the better to hug you with oh but grandmother what a terrible big mouth you have the better to eat you with and scarcely had the wolf said this than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up redcap when the wolf had appeased his appetite he lay down again in the bed fell asleep and began to snore very loud the huntsman was just passing the house and thought to himself how the old woman is snoring i must just see if she wants anything so he went into the room and when he came to the bed he saw that the wolf was lying in it do i find you here you old sinner said he i have long sought you then just as he was going to fire at him it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother and that she might still be saved so he did not fire but took a pair of scissors and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf when he had made two snips he saw the little redcap shining and then he made two snips more and the little girl sprang out crying ah how frightened i have been how dark it was inside the wolf and after that the aged grandmother came out alive also but scarcely able to breathe redcap however quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolfs belly and when he awoke he wanted to run away but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once and fell dead then all three were delighted the huntsman drew off the wolfs skin and went home with it the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which redcap had brought and revived but redcap thought to herself as long as i live i will never by myself leave the path to run into the wood when my mother has forbidden me to do so it also related that once when redcap was again taking cakes to the old grandmother another wolf spoke to her and tried to entice her from the path redcap however was on her guard and went straight forward on her way and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf and that he had said good morning to her but with such a wicked look in his eyes that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up well said the grandmother we will shut the door that he may not come in soon afterwards the wolf knocked and cried open the door grandmother i am little redcap and am bringing you some cakes but they did not speak or open the door so the greybeard stole twice or thrice round the house and at last jumped on the roof intending to wait until redcap went home in the evening and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness but the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts in front of the house was a great stone trough so she said to the child take the pail redcap i made some sausages yesterday so carry the water in which i boiled them to the trough redcap carried until the great trough was quite full then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf and he sniffed and peeped down and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough and was drowned but redcap went joyously home and no one ever did anything to harm her again stopword
